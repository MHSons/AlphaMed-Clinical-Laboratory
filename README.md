# AlphaMed Clinical Laboratory - Client-side React App

This is a client-side-only React application designed to run with localStorage (no backend).
It includes 20 departments and 20 tests per department (programmatically generated) to serve as a full demo dataset.

   npm install

2. Run locally:

Notes: This app uses `qrcode` and `jsbarcode` for QR and barcode generation in the browser, and TailwindCSS for responsive UI.
